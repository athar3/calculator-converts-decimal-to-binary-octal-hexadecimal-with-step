# calculator-converts-decimal-to-binary-octal-hexadecimal-with-step
a simple calculator to converts decimal number to binary, octal, and hexadecimal with some step. maybe in case someone ask u to converts some fucking decimal number in short time

all u need to do is put the damn input of the decimal number u want after run the fucking code!

make sure to use python compiler because i code this shit in python

lil bit story. i made this shit up because i was so fucked up to calculate fucking decimal in manual using paper. my stupid brain make me late to submit shit in on time. the shittiest part is i was late 4 minutes only. if only my brain can understand from the beginning and could submit shit in before the due, i wouldnt make this shit

I neither find a website that gives the step by step nor probably it never exists in the beginning, so i guess
