# calculator-converts-decimal-to-binary-octal-hexadecimal-with-step
a simple calculator to converts decimal number to binary, octal, and hexadecimal with some step. maybe in case someone ask u to converts some decimal numbers in short time with steps

all u need to do is put the input of the decimal number u want after run the code!

make sure to use python compiler because i code this in python

I neither find a website that gives the step by step nor probably it never exists in the beginning, so i guess
